# Spam-Ham-Classifier-App
Spam Ham Classifier Flask App
This is a web application built using Python and the Flask framework that classifies text messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). The app utilizes a Naive Bayes machine learning model for text classification.

Usage
Once the Flask application is running, you can access it through your web browser. The homepage will display a simple form where you can enter a text message. Click the "Classify" button to submit the message for classification.

The application will process the text using the pre-trained Naive Bayes model and display the classification result as either "Spam" or "Ham" on the next page.
